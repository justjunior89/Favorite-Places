# Favorite Places Fullstack

The motivation behind creating this application comes from my passion for
traveling. The concept is to be able to tap into a community of travelers that
have a passion for traveling. Users can log in and interact with the Google Map
and pin there favorite places anywhere around the world, using Google Map's API.
Keeping a local history of everyones favorite place for all to see. It includes a
picture image and a brief description of each favorite place. [Live Website](https://favorite-places-app.herokuapp.com/#/).

## System Overview

The front-end of this project is written in javascript(Node.js) w/React-Redux, while the back-end is utilizing a Ruby on Rails framework. The database, Postgres, features a
fully functional user authentication process encrypting all users' sensitive
login information. Only saving their user name and never storing
their password. Rendering a google map to display all the pertinent stored data from
the backend.

## Technical Challenges

Becoming fluent in React-Redux and understanding the base fundamentals of
the technology. How different states affect the overall layout of the UI
and when/where to deploy core components to application structure. understanding
component lifecycles and their impact on the development of the application.
